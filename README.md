Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
Description
This project uses K-Means and other clustering algorithms for customer segmentation on a wine marketing dataset. It covers data loading, wrangling, K-Means with Elbow and Silhouette methods, PCA visualization, and additional clustering techniques.

Prerequisites
Python 3+
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
Install with: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

How to Run
Place WineKMC.xlsx in the directory.
Open and run the notebook in Jupyter.
Files

Results
Optimal K from Silhouette: 9 (~0.147).
Spectral Clustering best with K=3 (0.224).
PCA (2 components): ~21.5% variance.
